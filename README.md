###Who we are
Hi, let’s introduce ourselves first: we are [Daniel Grießhaber](https://twitter.com/DanielGriehaber) and [Tobias Schneider](https://twitter.com/hpppxl), two master students (Computer Science and Media) of the Stuttgart Media University.

###TL;DR
Awesome, selfmade Camera Slider for ~180€ that can be controlled and programmed via an iPad app. If you read along you will find information on how to build one yourself!

###What this is
During the summer term of 2015 we developed a Camera Slider for controllable and repeatable time lapse and realtime shots. Since there are [already a couple DIY sliders](http://hackaday.com/2014/01/27/yet-another-diy-camera-slider/) out there, we wanted to give ours some special features to make it stick out from the masses:

###Awesome feature list:
#####2 motorized axis (linear movement and panning)
Most DIY Camera Sliders out there have only one remote axis. We have two (more is always better). ;-)
#####WiFi Access
Thanks to some recent development in WiFi integration we were able to add an iPad to control the Camera Slider.
#####iPad Control
There are two ways of controlling the Camera Slider. First of all, you can handle the slider via the live control and steer both axis independently. Furthermore, you can record your movement and save it for later playback.
 
Secondly, you can create simple scripts over an intuitive, graphical UI to program the slider for long duration shots (e.g. time lapse) with a slow, smooth and continuous movement that is repeatable until you are happy with the outcome.
